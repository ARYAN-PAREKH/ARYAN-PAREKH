                    <h5 class="card-title">Birbal</h5>
                    <h7 class="card-text">Birbal ( born Mahesh Das; 1528 – 16 February 1586[1]), or Raja Birbal, was a Hindu advisor and main commander (Mukhya Senapati) of army in the court of the Mughal emperor, Akbar. He is mostly known in the Indian subcontinent for the folk tales which focus on his wit. Birbal was appointed by Akbar as a Minister (Mantri) and used to be a Poet and Singer in around 1556–1562. He had a close association with Emperor Akbar and was one of his most important courtiers, part of a group called the navaratnas (nine jewels). In February 1586, Birbal led an army to crush an unrest in the north-west Indian subcontinent where he was killed along with many troops in an ambush by the rebel tribe. He was the only Hindu to adopt Din-i Ilahi, the religion founded by Akbar. Birbal was one of the first officers to join Akbar's court, possibly as early as 1556, when he was twenty-eight years old. He also had a naturally generous nature and all these traits combined—elegant repartee, largesse, and poetical talent—made Birbal the ideal Mughal courtier.

Local folk tales emerged primarily in 19th century involving his interactions with Akbar, portraying him as being extremely clever and witty, although it's highly unlikely that they are true considering strict court etiquettes of Mughals which won't had tolerated outspoken attitude of anyone like Birbal, also these tales have no mention in any official Mughal document. As the tales gained popularity in India, he became even more of a semi-fictional legendary figure across the Indian subcontinent. These most probably fictional tales involve him outsmarting rival courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning, often with giving witty and humorous responses and impressing Akbar.<div class="card col" style="width: 18rem;">

                    <h7 class="card-text">
      Tansen (c. 1493/1500 – 26 April 1586), also referred to as Tan Sen or Ramtanu, was a prominent figure of Hindustani classical music.[4] Born in a Hindu family, he learned and perfected his art in the northwest region of modern Madhya Pradesh. He began his career and spent most of his adult life in the court and patronage of the Hindu king of Rewa, Raja Ramchandra Singh (r.1555–1592), where Tansen's musical abilities and studies gained widespread fame.[4] This reputation brought him to the attention of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who sent messengers to Raja Ramchandra Singh, requesting Tansen to join the musicians at the Mughal court. Tansen did not want to go, but Raja Ramchandra Singh encouraged him to gain a wider audience, and sent him along with gifts to Akbar. In 1562, about the age of 60, the Vaishnava[5] musician Tansen joined the Akbar court, and his performances became a subject of many court historians.
